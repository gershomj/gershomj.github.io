Hello.

My name is Gershom and I love learning, sharing and dwelling on topics that dont get much thought.\
This blog is where I will be sharing my insights on various topics related to technology, science and psychology.\
I especially love the human mind and the wonderful way that it adapts, learns and grows as time moves on. Knowledge is power and that is why I will attempt to share as much knowledge as I can so you too can join me in this quest for knowledge!<br />

**DISCLAMER:** I only wish to share my thoughts and opinions therfore, if you find anything to be offensive or personally disagree on a certain topic, you are most welcome to click/tap out of this site.
